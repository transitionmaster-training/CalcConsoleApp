# .NET Samples - updated

The code in this repository represents programs that demonstrate Math operations such as addition, multiplication.


## Building a sample for Use code coverage for unit testing

Build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with [the .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Then run
these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample:

To build and run your sample:

1. Go to the sample folder and build to check for errors:

    ```console
    dotnet build
    ```

    another way to build project 
    ```console
    dotnet msbuild
    ```

2. Run your sample:

    ```console
    dotnet run
    ```

    another way to run project 
    ```console
    dotnet run --project .\CalcConsoleApp\CalcConsoleApp.csproj
    ```


## Code coverage tooling
There are two types of code coverage tools:

**DataCollectors**: DataCollectors monitor test execution and collect information about test runs. They report the collected information in various output formats, such as XML and JSON. For more information, see your first DataCollector.

**Report generators**: Use data collected from test runs to generate reports, often as styled HTML.

## Run Tests

```console
dotnet test
```

Usage

Coverlet is integrated into the Visual Studio Test Platform as a data collector. To get coverage simply run the following command:
```console
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```


## Console code coverage report

Generate console code coverage report with coverlet console

Installation - coverlet.console

```console
dotnet tool install -g coverlet.console
```

Usage - coverlet.console

```console
coverlet ./CalcConsoleApp.Tests/bin/Debug/net6.0/CalcConsoleApp.Tests.dll --target "dotnet" --targetargs "test --no-build"
```

## Generate reports

Installation - dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```console
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

Usage - Generating a .htm report using ReportGenerator
 
```console
reportgenerator -reports:"CalcConsoleApp.Tests\TestResults\adb8ac0b-c22f-4932-8a0b-e57685f74e95\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverageresults"
```

another way
```console
reportgenerator -reports:"CalcConsoleApp.Tests\TestResults\*\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverageresults"
```

## dotnet tools 

How to check what are tools installed on Server/Local
```console
dotnet tool search format
```
